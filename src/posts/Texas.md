Texas is famous for its sense of local identity and its of independence. The Lone Star State puts a premium on its unique history and traditions. The amusement park Six Flags comes from Texas, named after the six flags that have flown over Texasâ€”Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. The outline of Texas is popular on consumer goods like belt buckles and waffle irons. In the last several decades, the environmental slogan "Don't Mess with Texas" has become a slogan for Texan pride. And, more so than in any other state, there remains today a notable movement for Texas independence from the United States.
