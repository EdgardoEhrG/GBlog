Alabama is a southeastern U.S. state thatâ€™s home to significant landmarks from the American Civil Rights Movement. The city of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, now a museum, was a protest headquarters in the 1960s. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s church and the Rosa Parks Museum, dedicated to the activist, can be found in the capital of Montgomery.
